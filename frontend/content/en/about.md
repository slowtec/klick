# Webtool â€“ Climate Balance for Wastewater Treatment Plants with One Click

![Photo (outdoor shot) of a part of the biological treatment stage of a model wastewater treatment plant. A walkway leads over the treatment basin, where a group of people participating in a technical excursion is standing. Brown wastewater flows through the basin. On the water's surface, there is a yellow measurement dome that is tethered there. The dome is used for real-time measurement of (invisible) greenhouse gases that may be emitted from the basin.](klaeranlage.jpg)

Welcome to the interactive web tool by **Umwelttechnik BW**. The Click Tool is designed to support you as a wastewater treatment plant operator, municipality, or interested party in the following key activities:

- Estimating and visualizing the **greenhouse gas emissions of your wastewater treatment plant** in just a few steps.
- Downloading, saving, and/or further editing an initial **climate balance in summary graphs and tables** at a later time.
- Selecting and accounting for **measures to reduce GHG** emissions to improve the climate balance.

The Click Tool can be used both **with and without registration**. Your data remains protected in both cases and can only be accessed by you. The tool is free to use and offers easy usability. If you have any questions, feel free to contact us at: [KlickTool@umwelttechnik-bw.de](mailto:klicktool@umwelttechnik-bw.de)

Also, check out our [interactive KlicK-Wiki](https://codeberg.org/slowtec/klick/wiki): There, you will find useful information on calculation basics and literature references. We hope you enjoy the tool and look forward to your feedback.

Wishing you many valuable insights **for our climate and environment**, the KlicK team.
