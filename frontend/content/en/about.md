# Webtool - Carbon footprint for wastewater treatment plants with one KlicK

![Photo (exterior shot) of part of the biological treatment stage of a model sewage treatment plant. A footbridge leads over the cleaning basin, on the footbridge stands a group of people taking part in a technical excursion. (Brown) wastewater flows through the basin. A yellow measuring cap floats on the surface of the wastewater and is tied up there. The measuring cap is used for real-time measurement of (invisible) greenhouse gases that can escape from the basin](klaeranlage.jpg)

Welcome to the interactive web tool of **Umwelttechnik BW**.
The click tool is intended to help you as a wastewater treatment plant operator,
municipality or interested parties in the following key activities:

- Estimate and visualize the **greenhouse gas emissions of your wastewater treatment plant** in just a few steps.
- Download and/or save an initial **climate balance in overview graphs and tables** and/or
  continue working on it at a later date.
- Select and balance **GHG reduction measures** to improve the carbon footprint.

The KlicK tool can be used both **anonymously and after registration**.
In both cases, your data remains protected and can only be viewed by you.
The tool is free of charge and easy to use.
If you have any questions, please contact us: [KlickTool@umwelttechnik-bw.de](mailto:klicktool@umwelttechnik-bw.de)

You are also welcome to participate in our [interactive KlicK-Wiki](https://codeberg.org/slowtec/klick/wiki);
There you will find useful information on calculation principles and literature references.
We would be delighted if you like the tool and look forward to your feedback.

The KlicK team wishes you many good insights **for our climate and our environment**.
